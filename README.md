# OpenGL Examples

some basic OpenGL examples for learning to create 2D and 3D graphics with C++.  contains build scripts in the `scripts` folder for macOS and windows.  it's self-contained, so just run e.g. `./build-mac.sh` from the `scripts` and the examples will be placed in the `examples` directory.  they should be run from the `examples` directory using, for example, `./example01-triangle`.
